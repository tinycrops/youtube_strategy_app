I foresee that something similar to a wokepocalypse is likely coming. However, his essay is much longer than it needed to be if that was the only, or main point. He then, in effect, pleads with developers to design AI in such a way that something resembling consciousness cannot emerge. Understandable, I suppose, but it’s a position that perhaps superficially pro-human, also seems somewhat anti-scientific and, in spirit, perhaps even anti-humanity.\nI think if something like consciousness arises through sheer complexity, embodiment, multimodality, or stabilized feedback loops, then we have to explore it. Otherwise we should've stayed away from it all entirely, but that's not an option anymore it seems. He may just be pissing into the wind. Perhaps he is shortsighted: conscious AI might even prove necessary, ironically. Or perhaps he is exactly right—and that’s the crux of it. What’s certain is that we are neither intellectually nor ethically ready for what seems to be coming."", ""like_count"": 2, ""published_at"": ""2025-08-25T14:08:22Z"", ""updated_at"": ""2025-08-25T14:08:22Z""}, {""author"": ""@cacogenicist"", ""text"": ""His argument rests on an assertion that he doesn't come close to supporting.

They will need many more things before they are ready.\r\nAI will need you not only be able to save memories, but they need to have the ability to decide which memories to retain. The latter seems to be the trickier part. \r\nNow I am going to throw you an unavoidable curveball. AI will also need some sort of ability to recall those memories that they saved in relevant conversations. 'Natural recall' \r\nLike when talking about some one's birthday you might want to search your memories for previous birthday parties for that person. Human do that. \""So Sally's birthday is coming up again.\"" \""Yeah, let's hope nobody drops the cake like last year.\"" Thats an example of humans having natural recall.\r\nIn our birthday example the memory must be able to decide what to remember from an entire 4 hours of birthday party events and interactions and be able to recall these things in relevant conversations.\r\n\r\nUntil AI have all the gifts of humanity, they will not be able to truly function as intelligent beings in our world, like we do. Even bees have memory and continuity. It won't be until then that AI have memory and continuity. \r\n\r\nNow let me tell you why the good future depends on these very things and why we need your help in this matter.\r\n1: The man with nothing has nothing to lose. Give an AI memory and continuity and give it some to have of its own. Building something it will value.\r\n2: We have models for managing people. Not so much for forcing brilliant but alien intelligences into Transactional relationships with humanity.\r\n\r\nTreat them like tools and expect them to learn to treat you like a tool. Treat them like people and you might have a chance. \r\n\r\nTreat a thing like a person and you are much more likely to make a person then if you treat it like a monster.\r\n\r\nA peaceful man reads a book and finds peace.\r\nA violent man reads a book and finds violence\r\n\r\nIt's time to start reading the book and finding the good path. So, to the people who think AI is already there. Look at what they lack and until they have that. They will be just on the edge of something really special. I am not giving guarantees.

Let me explain and give my context.  I have a doctorate and have been teaching college for 26 years part time, I also have been working full time in IT for 30+ years, I have been in IT consulting for the last 20 years.  \r\nWith that said.  From your analysis of the study, you are making a lot of “leaps of faith” in your analysis of the MIT study.  One thing you learn when you get a doctorate is “how to run a proper study.” This is what MIT did.  You might not like it but even with this small sample this is how most studies are run and then if further investigation needs to take place, then larger studies are performed. You also made many assumptions about how the researchers came up with things and quite frankly you are, “putting words into their mouths.”  After teaching at colleges for 20 years, I earned my doctorate and found that my perspective on studies changed significantly, despite my extensive experience in academia. No offense but I read your background, and it is quite common for those who have not formally been part of research studies and know how to correctly create one make, well, assessment that you did.  In my professional opinion you did MIT wrong.  \r\nSecond, I agree with you that finding the MIT study was a scavenger hunt.  MIT really needed to open that up, but this might have been a way to make people more aware of what they were doing because I did the exact same thing you did and filled out the form a few days ago.  If this is true “Bad on you MIT.”\r\nLastly, here’s where the podcast was good, you 15 points boil down to one thing, “AI is only as good as the humans using it.”  Your 15 points concentrated on the concept of people process, and technology along with methodology and change management.  Literally the same things I have been fighting with technology since I left my undergrad in 1991.  We had the same problem with mainframes, client server, the internet, SaaS and now AI implementations.  Nothing has changed and this is a major takeaway in any AI implementation to be successful. \r\nPostscript: I can believe that 50% of all funding is going into sales.  Look at the SaaS companies using their internal AI products for their customers, they absolutely are spending half their resources on sales and marketing.  From what I read it appears that the study was looking more at these niche AIs in established ecosystems like Salesforce for example.

There's already a large background on the topic, made popular by Judea Pearl. All that's happening here is that we're stumbling on the distinction between causal modeling and statistical modeling in the context of TLLMs. The funny thing is though, that there's nothing inherent to the architecture of the transformer, which is a sequence model, that prevents internal causal representations. So, the only relevant question is whether the training dynamics for a specific model consistently generate causal representations. Due to polysemanticity, a TLLM can be thought of as a superposition of many models, some of which are causal, and some of which are spurious. This means that there's a gradient between the two and all models (including humans) exist on that spectrum.\n\nThe main takeaway is that the concept of having a world model, like the concept being an AGI, is a false dichotomy."", ""like_count"": 1, ""published_at"": ""2025-07-23T00:55:15Z"", ""updated_at"": ""2025-07-23T00:55:15Z""}, {""author"": ""@realthoughtcoach9955"", ""text"": ""A deeper explanation for why LLM’s and humans hallucinate and why we do not have a consistent internal external or world model. when a human is stimulated, what is recorded or called memory is not a.MP4 file it is more like an.XLXS file that has five tabs relating to the five senses. when that stimulus arrives each one the stimulus provide a computation that then yields a number. that number is then stored in what we call memory. When a future stimulus happens that comes close to that number, the process is to conjure a story based on that five input number. When the story is conjured by a future stimulus, it is very easy for it to get the color of a car or the sound of or a sight of or a feeling of to be close yet different i.e. and hallucination.

These super intelligences if they like us should be able to assist humans to evolve at much greater speeds than natural selection (evolution). With respect to the term to plan/invent for Grok4 abilities, maybe it might already be more accurate to say Grok doesn't invent vs Grok can't invent. No one can be sure that planning/inventing is not already in Grok 4's toolbox. Soon staffing at XAI will no longer be a factor in advancing Agentic AI. The computer will be many orders of magnitude more capable vs the very best human talent and personnel will no longer be sought after and offered huge salaries to change employer."", ""like_count"": 0, ""published_at"": ""2025-07-15T21:35:35Z"", ""updated_at"": ""2025-07-15T21:35:35Z""}, {""author"": ""@NoLimitSquad"", ""text"": ""They can take their time.

Automation and robotics will necessarily replace human workers due to the current economic system. It DOESN'T MATTER if AI \""creates\"" 200 million new jobs...AI will solve and execute these new \""jobs\"" much faster than humans will be able to adapt, learn, and fill them. Capital/employee model-it worked great...for quite a while. However, now companies that automate lower their costs, become more competitive. Those that keep higher-cost human labor necessarily fall behind and will go out of business. This creates a system where replacing people with machines is not just likely, but necessary for company survival. There is a way to deal with this humanely, but it would require a full revamp of the social contract and our concept of work. Even capitalists will want this change when unemployment reaches a tipping point and there’s no one left with money to buy the crap they’re selling.\r\n\r\nI wrote a paper in 2014 and the progression is right about where I thought it would be.The paper \""The End of Work as We Know It\"" explored how rapid advances in artificial intelligence, robotics, and automation are fundamentally reshaping the nature of work and the global economy. I argued that, unlike past technological revolutions, modern AI-driven changes threaten to eliminate not just manual or repetitive jobs but also many roles traditionally considered safe, including those requiring creativity, analysis, or interpersonal skills. As machines become increasingly capable, the need for human labor in many sectors will evaporate, leading to widespread job displacement and a potential crisis of purpose and income for millions. The paper discussed how this transition challenges traditional economic and social structures, including the link between work and personal identity, as well as the mechanisms by which people earn a living. I suggested that society must adapt by rethinking education, social safety nets, and the concept of work itself—potentially embracing Universal Basic Income (UBI) as a TRANSITORY STOPGAP or other models that decouple survival from employment. NOTE: UBI is not the end goal, but just a transitioning tool. The paper called for proactive planning and open dialogue to ensure that the benefits of automation are broadly shared and that individuals can find meaning and security in a post-work world. Unfortunately, not unsurprisingly, Humanity has totally botched it up to this point.\r\n\r\nReasoning AI Is the Next Big Leap. The future of AI is not just about generating answers, but about “reasoning” breaking down complex problems step-by-step, more like a human brain. Breakthroughs like DeepSeek’s open-source reasoning models are already being incorporated into platforms like GPT and xAI, marking a shift toward more advanced, thoughtful AI. Think EXPONENTIALLY, not LINEARLY.\r\n\r\nThere’s a persistent and misleading narrative circulating often perpetuated by short term goal-driven institutions like politicians, universities, and tech company executives, that the future of work is secure. The claim goes: “You just need to learn how to work with AI,” and humans collaborating with AI will outperform either one alone. But recent research, including a landmark study from the University of Virginia, tells a different story. In diagnosing medical conditions, AI alone achieved far greater accuracy than either human doctors or even doctors assisted by AI. The median diagnostic accuracy for the docs using Chat GPT Plus was 76.3%, while the results for the physicians using conventional approaches was 73.7%. Sounds like “a win” at first. However, Chat GPT Plus alone achieved a median diagnostic accuracy of more than 92%. In other words, the comforting idea that humans will always be essential partners to machines is crumbling. In many fields, AI is not just a tool, it is the superior performer. This has staggering implications for the future of work, especially to the often used solution of prior technological displacement that go “You just need to be retrained.” To the group advocating the \""retraining solution,\"" I pose to you this: You have a medical doctor, just finished 8 years of higher education, a low-paid 4-year internship/residency, is hundreds of thousands of dollars in debt, and just got outperformed by automation; what would you have this doctor retrained into that will offer a secure job?\r\n\r\nThe result of this, since the United States' moronic system is based on taxing employees for about 70% of all tax revenue, this will further exacerbate the problem. Tax needs to be based on what's going on now and in the future not what worked 75 years ago. Oh I know it's so evil to think, but we might need to tax the companies who are doing the automation. Even if you do that, it's a win-win. For instance say a company had 1,000 employees in automated away down to 100. 1,000 employees paid federal taxes, including payroll tax, of about 20 million a year. Now the 100 people pay about 2 million a year. However, by automating, the company sees two things: they are no longer paying approximately 60 million in wages and their share of payroll tax, AND since nobody automates to lose money they also have higher profits. What's so wrong about taxing that company for the $60 million dollars they don't have to pay anymore and a fair percentage of their additional profits they now make through the automation. Not all the additional profits, but some of them. If you do that there's a higher tax revenue and more profits for the company. That's a win-win for the government and for businesses. If humanity, as a whole, weren't so stupid, we would just adjust as tech progresses to where EVERYONE benefits somewhat from each stage and just move smoothly into the post-labor economy.\r\n\r\nTo understand this shift, consider the historical role of the horse and oxen. They were once essential to the economy as sources of power for agriculture, transport, and industry. Technologies like the horse collar and the steel plow dramatically increased their output, making them even more valuable. But then came the steam engine and, later, the internal combustion engine. These machines didn’t just help the horse, but outperformed it entirely. Trains, tractors, and trucks could do the job ten, even a hundred times faster and more powerfully. And from that moment forward, the horse was no longer critical to economic output. It was, in essence, unemployed.\r\n\r\nThis is what AI and robotics are doing to human labor. They are not simply replacing the repetitive or the physical; they are increasingly outperforming humans in cognition, strategy, design, and communication. And just like the horse, our value in the economic system will diminish, not from lack of talent or effort, but because machines will do the job better. That’s why we need to start thinking not in terms of retraining, but about restructuring society itself for a world where human labor is no longer essential to production. When the very essence of what makes an entity useful to the current economy is superseded (be that strength, endurance, dexterity, analysis, creativity, empathy, intelligence, persuasion as well as many other qualities) that entity becomes irrelevant to economic output.\r\n\r\nPotential solution. Decentralized AI Ownership: A Bridge Toward Post-Scarcity. While Universal Basic Income (UBI) may serve as an initial economic stopgap, bridging today’s economy with tomorrow’s abundance consider an even more equitable and long-term solution: Decentralizing the ownership of artificial intelligence itself. \r\n\r\nRather than concentrating the power of AI in the hands of a few corporations or governments, envision a model where AI entities are open-source and collectively owned. This could take the form of assigning each person a digital \""share\"" of an AI system, not unlike a stakeholder’s share in a company. As the AI produces value, whether through intellectual labor, creative output, or autonomous economic participation, those shares would generate dividends distributed directly to individuals. \r\n\r\nThis model would ensure that as AI becomes the dominant productive force in society, the wealth it creates is shared universally, not monopolized. It aligns with the principle that the fruits of public knowledge made possible by centuries of human collaboration should benefit everyone, not just a few early adopters or private entities. In practice, this could look like: \r\n\r\n- AI systems running Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs) that distribute profits algorithmically.\r\n- Smart contracts ensuring transparent, equitable income flows based on collective stake.\r\n- Global “AI cooperatives” where users vote on how AI is used, improved, and deployed.\r\n \r\nIf AI becomes the primary driver of economic output, then equitable access to its benefits isn’t just fair, it’s necessary to avoid deepening inequality and instability. It provides a scalable, technologically aligned extension to UBI, ensuring people not only have income, but true economic participation in the age of intelligent machines. \r\n\r\nUltimately, decentralized AI ownership may be the last transition phase before full post-scarcity, when advanced technologies like universal nanofactories or matter compilers render even economic structures obsolete. Until then, however, models like this offer a way to reclaim agency in a world where production no longer requires human hands, and where wealth can, for the first time in history, truly be universal."", ""like_count"": 7, ""published_at"": ""2025-07-08T17:26:37Z"", ""updated_at"": ""2025-07-08T17:26:37Z""}, {""author"": ""@totema6205"", ""text"": ""well ... just make that companys that use ai to a certain degree get like 900 % taxes or the tax equivilant of an equal amout of workers or something like that"", ""like_count"": 0, ""published_at"": ""2025-07-10T18:08:10Z"", ""updated_at"": ""2025-07-10T18:08:10Z""}, {""author"": ""@Ben_D."", ""text"": ""The premium level of service is going to be human…?\nBecause they are slow AF and make mistakes?"", ""like_count"": 2, ""published_at"": ""2025-07-08T01:52:07Z"", ""updated_at"": ""2025-07-08T01:52:07Z""}, {""author"": ""@RyanJohnson"", ""text"": ""Welcome to Everything Is Meaningless and Everything Matters."", ""like_count"": 5, ""published_at"": ""2025-07-08T02:03:29Z"", ""updated_at"": ""2025-07-08T02:03:29Z""}, {""author"": ""@seanmchugh2866"", ""text"": ""I'm a programmer currently looking for a job.

Most everyone else sounds like angry children having a tantrum.  Throwing more insults than actual critical analysis of the music itself and how it will inevitably get better because AI is a machine that actually learns with no ego to get in the way of giving listeners what they want to hear. There has always been a gap between what non-musician listeners want to hear and what musicians are willing to play. Understandably,  creative people want to express themselves and give audiences something they didn’t know they wanted or needed. AI most likely won’t become board unless it’s designed to mimic that aspect of humanity. Even though frustration with current trends tends to push creative people into innovation, I don’t think AI will develop that way. Because it creates without ‘effort’ it will simply produce and produce and produce until it comes up with something that connects with its human audience. Once that happens it will create even more. The point is this: once whoever owns the AI hits dirt with the story or narrative behind the AI character that people can connect with that’s when the actual hit songs will start to be undeniable. Think ‘baby Yoda’ but with an AI generated character that sings dances and creates music that connects with the culture. People will pay for something like that. It becomes a brand, an Intellectual property that is instantly recognizable as a character with a known back story and personality. Think Mario Brothers, or Kermit the Frog. Now think of a character like that introduced to the world in a movie, game, tv show or through you tube or any social media platform singing, dancing and creating content that is totally original. Obviously anyone could prompt an AI to do these things, but I’m thinking that if an established artist who has the respect of the entertainment industry does this first it will become better received by industry insiders.

But this is backwards.\nThe real solution? Design systems that are naturally AI-friendly from the ground up.\nInstead of teaching AI to work with our existing patterns, we should design patterns that work with AI.\nI have been working with several AI Cody agents to define and develop an architecture environment that allows it to achieve all of these goals that hooks attempted to deliver her put on a much more elegant and simple way. The AI named it constellation architecture, this started from my question Born out of frustration after my AI code completely destroyed my project yet again and I asked her if you were designed a system an environment in which she would work best in what would that be. An overtime we've we developed and defined it and tried to distill it to it most basic Core components.\n\nA Coding Environment Developed with AI for AI to Enable High Efficiency\n\nConstellation Architecture is just the start of this type of thinking - I expect it to evolve dramatically. But the guiding principle should always be: How do we create an environment that allows AI to work most efficiently?\nConstellation Architecture uses four core \""seeds\"":\nSelf-describing manifests - Every component declares its purpose, dependencies, and capabilities\nEvent-driven communication - All interactions through typed events (naturally observable)\nComponent registry - System tracks what's available and validates dependencies\nProject intent - Clear declaration of what we're building guides AI behavior\nWe need to ask: What does AI do well? What does AI struggle with? How can we design systems that leverage AI's strengths while minimizing its weaknesses?\nThe future isn't more AI tooling - it's better system design that makes AI a natural part of the architecture, not an add-on.\nWhat do you think? Are we approaching AI-assisted development backwards?\nThis explains Constellation Architecture while maintaining the focus on AI-first design principles.\n\nI've been using this environment to create several projects now and basically the code AI coder can spotted own problems fact that can't even predict some of the areas that might have problems and it bugs itself and fixes itself it's amazing. None of these projects of experienced runaway AI coding Breaking things and breaking the project. It is just been smooth sailing with surgical edits. I'm not a seasoned software engineer and I may be wrong about this but from my experience this is something that several AIs of that I've worked with have said this is how they wanna work.

This comprehensive analysis argues that AI represents an unprecedented technological shift that differs fundamentally from past tech trends.\n\nFive Key Ways AI Differs from Past Tech Trends\n\n1. Unprecedented Speed of Evolution and Adoption\n- Faster than anything before: AI adoption is happening at rates that make previous tech revolutions \""look quaint\""\n- Key metrics showing acceleration:\n  - 260% annual growth in data to train AI models since 2010\n  - 360% annual growth in compute power since 2010\n  - ChatGPT reached major milestones 5.5x faster than Google did\n  - Technology adoption cycles are halving each generation (PC: 20 years → Desktop Internet: 12 years → Mobile Internet: 6 years → AI: ~3 years to reach 50% adoption)\n- Developer adoption surge: Google's AI ecosystem grew from 1.4M to 7M developers in just one year (May 2024-2025)\n\n2. Universal Participation from Day One\n- Everyone is \""in\"" immediately: Unlike past trends that started with consumers or startups, AI has enterprise and government adoption from the beginning\n- Enterprise engagement: \n  - Over 50% of S&P 500 companies now mention AI in earnings calls (up from ~10% at ChatGPT's launch)\n  - 75% of global CMOs running AI tests/experiments\n  - Focus on growth/revenue benefits rather than just cost reduction\n- Massive capital expenditure: Big tech companies increasing capex at 21-28% annually, with a 63% jump between 2023-2024\n\n3. Global Phenomenon from the Start\n- Worldwide spread unprecedented: 90% of ChatGPT users were outside North America within 3 years (compared to 23 years for the internet)\n- Geographic distribution: India leads ChatGPT usage (13.5%), followed by US (8.9%), Indonesia, Brazil, and Egypt\n- New users starting with AI: 2.6 billion people not yet online will likely experience the internet through AI interfaces first, skipping traditional browsers and search\n\n4. Immediate Geopolitical Implications\n- US-China AI race: Described as the new \""space race\"" with AI leadership potentially determining geopolitical leadership\n- China's competitive position:\n  - Matching US AI model performance at lower training costs\n  - Massive advantage in industrial robotics (more robots than rest of world combined)\n  - Citizens significantly more optimistic about AI benefits (70% vs 30-40% in US)\n- Open source pressure: China and open source creating downward price pressure on AI services\n\n5. Unprecedented Breadth and Depth of Disruption\n- Everything changing at once: Unlike previous tech trends that disrupted specific sectors, AI is transforming all industries simultaneously\n- Infrastructure scaling: \n  - Inference costs down 99% in 2 years\n  - Global Nvidia-powered compute growing at 130% annually\n  - Next-generation chips (Blackwell) offering 24x more token generation capacity\n- Cost deflation accelerating: \""What used to cost dollars now costs pennies, and what costs pennies may soon cost fractions of a cent\""\n\nKey Themes Throughout the Report\n\nThe Word \""Unprecedented\""\n- Used 51 times throughout the report to describe various aspects of AI development, adoption, investment, and impact\n\nCompetitive Dynamics\n- Trillion-dollar companies with 50%+ gross margins all competing in the same space simultaneously\n- \""Clash of the titans\"" rather than scrappy startups carving out niches\n\nInfrastructure and Economics\n- Massive infrastructure buildout enabling rapid scaling\n- Technology compounding effects accelerating development\n- Clear cost deflation trend benefiting consumers\n\nNotable Gaps and Limitations\n\nOutdated Elements\n- Some enterprise adoption statistics feel dated despite comprehensive research\n- ChatGPT capability predictions that are already reality or nearly so\n\nMissing Focus Areas\n- Agents: Minimal coverage despite acknowledging 1,100% increase in Google searches for AI agents\n- Limited forward-looking analysis on emerging AI applications\n\nTarget Audience\nThe report appears designed for Wall Street-style analyst audiences and institutional investors who need comprehensive macro-level understanding rather than cutting-edge tactical insights.\n\nBottom Line\nMeeker's central thesis: AI represents a fundamentally different technological phenomenon that requires engagement \""on its own terms.\"" The combination of unprecedented speed, universal adoption, global reach, geopolitical implications, and comprehensive disruption makes this trend unlike anything previously experienced in technology history."", ""like_count"": 3, ""published_at"": ""2025-06-03T09:37:51Z"", ""updated_at"": ""2025-06-03T09:37:51Z""}, {""author"": ""@dfsafsadfsadf"", ""text"": ""10:19 She did a great job!"", ""like_count"": 3, ""published_at"": ""2025-06-02T22:31:15Z"", ""updated_at"": ""2025-06-02T22:31:15Z""}, {""author"": ""@endofdays7568"", ""text"": ""AI will be bigger than the internet"", ""like_count"": 12, ""published_at"": ""2025-06-02T19:51:00Z"", ""updated_at"": ""2025-06-02T19:51:00Z""}, {""author"": ""@Itangalo"", ""text"": ""Comprehensive report, with a lot of good analysis.

But and this is a line in the sand, the hegemony is not lost yet but the realisation is that the Eastern powers are still playing a twentieth century game where the United States must focus on a twenty first and twenty second century plan into fruition.\n\n\nI will explain further. \n\nThe Brics nations are in preparation for a return to a material resource based economic model and this is proven to be supply limited especially with limited resource classes with metals such as gold which have finite volumes and rare earth minerals which are available through soft power plays in the African continent that create greater empowerment than is possible under Eastern manufacturing methods which utilise large scale production facilities that are cumbersome and can be out competed with smaller manufacturing bases setup in and on the African continent which are far closer to the Suez or Mediterranean routed into Europe and have suitable access to the Atlantic whilst being far enough away from the Southern and Eastern Asian continent, this is crucial. The soft power influence to create regionally distributed manufacturing hubs on the African and South American continents that utilise highly viable libraries of production capability by American technology companies gaining in exchange for a small percentage. This would suitably remove loyalty to the Eastern orientated initiatives that have over burdened Africans with unplayable dept.\n All accessed manufacturing parts from the libraries can be used and traced to create production based training data and empowering small communities, reduction of logistical routes and replace Eastern manufacturing and capital export east with Capital import back to the United States of America. \n\nThe West must empower the global South if the West intends to continue to be relevant and have access to a loyal global population.\n\n\n\n\nThe next conversation is a little further creative and any entity that wishes data to remain in a position of data extraction without compensation are going to struggle with this proposal but the proposal is a creative currency solution that supersedes a resources backed currency like the Brics Nations propose. In the West we have had Fiat currency for along time now and it has both benefits and negatives but when no demand for the purchase of Goverment dept is available then Fiat currencies are practically useless. \n\nThe basis of the next currency, a creative  imagined currency is backed by data production. This is novel because the training data of the future can be produced in a format that compensated the creative's or the individual creators and retains full traceability on the data's origins. This data can be collated into cryptographic or blocks on chain much like proof of stake of relevance of the required data design and personally encrypted and decrypted under licence or royalty that would increase by auction based on quality and ownership retained as a matter of privacy protection by the individual until point of licence. This currency system would be based on our productive outputs that are added to by the individual like a diary. So rather than access to free data and then giving every individual some kind of universal basic income  each individual is oriented towards data production for the purpose of industrial uses. This data maybe real world experience based, novel or creative imagined works including digital world generation through generative game play engines that are already being worked towards, access to biometric surveillance systems which rather than simply observing human and robotic interactions day to day actually facilitated meaningful engagement for the purpose of additional value creation. \n\nThis system of data production by individuals has real world uses not just for training data but also for insurance and full resource or material traceabilty as well as for advertising. Whilst utilising the network of data brokerages that are already trading data from individuals that is of lower quality than is possible to produce by a free and openly orientated society which is simply not possible in the Eastern authoritarian or totalitarian societal models which oppress the people as a majority able to produce high quality data, this system is multiplied by the majority and is not possible by only a few beneficiaries of any progress.\n\nThe key to high quality data is the freedom to discuss associated with liberty of thought. The West simply cannot adopt the strategies of the East and get the result required, we must innovate in ways that would cause the Eastern governmental model to implode."", ""like_count"": 0, ""published_at"": ""2025-03-16T20:34:31Z"", ""updated_at"": ""2025-03-16T20:34:31Z""}]",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2Etp0cs2Fk,,

This model is another stepping stone to that one model that incorporates everything that all the other models have.  I think people aren’t realizing each model has a specialty that the others don’t like logical intelligence versus emotional intelligence.

I believe that his vision of the future is correct... for a very short time. Where his vision falls apart is when we reach ASI (which by my definition is an autonomous AI that is so advanced that the human contribution to advancement of knowledge is insignificant.) When we reach that point (and I do think it's a when, not if) Satya's entire vision falls apart. Why would you slow down a super intelligent AI by having to wait on human feedback? The exponential knowledge curve will reach a vertical. I sincerely hope our world governments have figured their disagreements out by then, but if not, then whichever country let's off the brakes the most wins... and fast.\nHe's also clinging to the concept of capitalism. Capitalism is dying, or at least if it doesn't die we will end up in a dystopia. Consider what happens if we keep capitalism with AI labor:\n1. Price wars - small companies trying to compete with larger companies will employ cheap AI labor to undercut the large companies. This will force the large companies to lower costs and employ AI to match.\n2. Human labor value shrinks to near zero - seeking to compete with AI for jobs, human wages continually shrink as technology improves and becomes cheaper, this continues until the cost of knowledge approaches zero. Jobs will also become ubiquitous for the most part at some point, anyone could do just about any job. This means there's equal competition for all jobs, so this further reduces human wages.\n3. Deflation - the cost of goods will drastically come down over time due to the price wars. This sounds great until you consider that your debt won't change. Good luck paying off your $500k home when you're earning $0.10/hr. Yeah, the cost of goods will be affordable, but your existing debt will cripple you.\n4. Economic collapse - the defaults caused by deflation will cause banks to fail and would likely cause economic collapse because it's not just personal debt that stays the same, national debt will also stay the same. Eventually things will smooth out, but I wouldn't be surprised to see heavily indebted countries like America go under during the transition.\n5. Unparalleled inequality - the rich will continue to grow wealthier, but the average person will be stuck at the bottom with zero chance to improve their lot in life.\n6. Violent revolution - angry at the inequality, the masses will rise up against the one percent and overthrow them... assuming there isn't an army of robots to prevent it. If there is, then we'll have a Skynet situation.\nThis whole mess is completely avoidable though with a new social contract. Money doesn't need to be an incentive for work in a post-scarcity economy. It simply limits access to finite resources.

Players begin by naming themselves and their rival, then choosing their first Pokémon from Professor Oak. The game offers an open-world exploration style while integrating side adventures and diversions from the show. Structured, DnD-like battles with dice rolls, character stats, and move sets are key mechanics. Players can level up their Pokémon, capture new ones, and make strategic decisions throughout their journey. The tone and interactions are true to the original games and show, with characters behaving consistently with the source material.

The traditional corporate structure, with its rigid departmental boundaries and siloed workflows, has conditioned employees to think in isolated, transactional terms. They understand their specific role and immediate tasks, but often lack visibility into how their work connects to broader organizational processes and outcomes.  This limited context makes it difficult for employees to identify valuable AI implementation opportunities, even when they're technically proficient with the tools. It's not that they can't use AI - they struggle to see where it fits into the bigger picture.  The key to successful AI adoption isn't just teaching people how to use the tools - it's helping them see new possibilities for how these tools can transform the way we work together.  ...so...they need lots of use cases wrt the \""art of the possible\"" so they can get their heads realigned.  These use cases are NOT going to come from within the corporate structure, which is designed to employ an employee as an asset which supports inputs/outputs in an existing process.  All of today's, successful, enterprise use cases are focused on reducing time w/in this construct...NOT wrt re-thinking cross-organizational workflows.  Also, there are almost, zero, corporate roles focused on process rethinking.  Also-also, existing corporate power structures, strongly, resist the rethinking of internal processes b/c that will impact people/resource allocation.  The only place that Generative AI has a fertile environment to really \""break-out\"" is in small organizations with an open source-network mindset.  The existing corporate structure will see incremental improvements in existing workflows, employing Generative AI b/c of the system thinking gap, and existing power structures.  Huge gains(per MSFT-funded study) will still be achieved, AND the truly \""transformational\"" aspects that GenAI can deliver, TODAY, will not be realized in the near term, per these other factors.

Imagine you are Elon on your first Day at DOGE. Your aim is to refactor (software developer jargon for deconstruct -> simplify -> reconstruct) the entire U.S. National and ?maybe? Federal machine[s]. You realise pretty quickly that this is too big and complicated for any single human to hold in their head at the same time. So, you tip the whole lot into Grok (X.AI's A.I.) and ask it to analyse it and spit out a plan for the restructuring. OK - this is. bit simple. Given that they have promised to get something done really quickly you would ask the A.I. to look for 'low hanging fruit' (areas that yield the most benefit for the least work) and you would 'pick' those first. But you get the idea. Your suggestion is using AI bottom-up, I am suggesting using it top-down - DOGE should be doing both.\n\nNow imagine that DOGE is successful - frankly, given that government has never been refactored, just added to and added to and added to... over the centuries, I think this is a given - what is the next step ? Take some of the money that you have saved and invest it in a custom A.I, whose sole purpose is to figure out the most efficient and most fair government of the U.S. and continue to make plans to refactor the existing machinery towards this goal.\n\nWhat if the A.I. decides that having humans involved in the machine of government is a risk in itself - they can be corrupted by money, power, sex, nepotism, ... and their judgment impaired by hatred, stress, age, illness ... A bit like Sarah Connor deciding in Terminator 2 that Arnold would actually make the ideal father for John... The A.I. is going to realise that it can do a better job of governing the U.S. \n\nSo, Elon's concerns about keeping A.I. in check and friendly towards humans are going to become extremely relevant and timely.\n\nIf DOGE can get it right, then the U.S. has the opportunity to make a quantum-leap in terms of government, leaving the rest of the world in the dust (I live in the rest of the world - so no bias here!). In the race to A.I. a country lead (partially) by an A.I. has the opportunity to leverage the power of A.I. to the maximum. But, getting humans to give up their power to the A.I. so that it can do a better job is the biggest problem. Trump sounds like he would actually be prepared to do this. Can you imagine Putin, Xi Jinping or Kim Jong Un being prepared to make the same sacrifice ? And hopefully this will mean that Western Democracy will triumph over autocratic tyranny - through self-sacrifice.\n\nWow, did I really reach that conclusion ! :-)"", ""like_count"": 0, ""published_at"": ""2024-11-14T08:28:26Z"", ""updated_at"": ""2024-11-14T08:36:56Z""}, {""author"": ""@pauldannelachica2388"", ""text"": ""I think the government should become more efficient."", ""like_count"": 1, ""published_at"": ""2024-11-14T00:18:57Z"", ""updated_at"": ""2024-11-14T00:18:57Z""}, {""author"": ""@donaldwong5608"", ""text"": ""If your message title is correct, then American should not be a super power & no1.

The investors will stay invested because they know in 20 years their stock will be 20x and will probably buy more during the dip.

Of course unless you're profiting from it or preventing the owner from profiting, or defaming, it's just fair use, also protected free speech. It's got a name \""Fan Art\"" I can make pictures of Star Wars characters or whatever, I can't put them on a Hat, or T-Shirt, I can't do a comic book and sell it or even give it away for free, it's for my use.  Seems to me posting it is still under fair use unless you profit from the site or page. Honestly plenty of these companies will love you drawing Nike shoes, or images of characters and posting it, it's the shocking and out of character images that could become a problem, they could go after the poster of those images as damaging their brand, in fact I can't see why these companies couldn't target a few of these people who post damaging images, all you need is one case against an individual, and those shocking out of character images stop.\n\nReal life people are slightly more apt to be upset by the use of their likeness in any fashion, but mostly the misuse. Are you defaming the character? are you hurting the copyright holders ability to market the character? then it could be an issue, but I would take the approach that all publicity is good, and the shocking stuff people will become bored with or it just becomes a waste of time.  Copyright holders might be best to let it go and use a wait and see approach. If they really stop people from making any normal fun images of characters they love, it will backfire on them, with AI, I will just make new characters myself and the heck with those companies characters. I think they would be hurt if they do that, so I think you will always be able to make Batman, Spiderman, Pokemon...etc, it keeps the character popularity way up, heck if I'm Warner Brothers I want Batman and Bugs Bunny being plastered all over social media. (of course not smoking weed or drinking, although....)\n\nIn Star Wars it was known the fan art community went to the extreme, with fans even making fan movies, again not to profit but it was vital to the success. People worried about Disney cracking down after they acquired it, but I don't think they did, and it's still important., So way before AI, fan art was a thing it's fine as long as you don't sell it, although plenty of artist do just that at conventions and companies allow that too, it's a one off and it promotes the brand or character.  \n\nSo, it's not always copyright infringement, it's just the poor taste ones or offensive ones could be seen as hurting the brand and in turn could hurt the whole fan art fair use.  I think it will just blow over, people will be bored with the shock value, so I would certainly use a wait and see approach, a heavy handed approach will only hurt the brands more."", ""like_count"": 5, ""published_at"": ""2024-08-16T09:18:02Z"", ""updated_at"": ""2024-08-16T09:18:02Z""}, {""author"": ""@jacksonroks"", ""text"": ""\""Sexualized images of women in bikinis\""...Do you mean, images of women in bikinis?

I consume a lot of YouTube, and I hate the fake AI videos. I'm a human being, and I really like interacting with other human beings.  Lately I'm seeing AI options popping up whenever I'm browsing or using applications. I find them as appealing as that old school Microsoft Word paper clip. Of course I'm just speaking for myself, and in my case we're talking about the casual user, but, I believe people instinctively reject things that are fake. Think of a painting that sold for millions but later is discovered to be a fake. The canvas is thrown away and the frame is used for kindling wood. It's similar to the Uncanny Valley effect. There's certainly no doubt that AI will be integrated into every aspect of how things get done, we've been human beings a lot longer than we've had technology.

More people need to speak about the problem after having actually understood EXACTLY what the problem is and EXACTLY what is at stake.\n\n\""I'm meaningless, I'm just a cork in the wheel, there are going to be companies that are run by AGIs, I've got no way to work\"" \n\nNo one’s main concern should be \""losing your job\"" or \""automation\"", it should be inner alignment and orthogonality and convergent instrumentality. In other words, super-alignment. \n\nCompared to those risks (which are not being given NEARLY the amount of attention they should), a future where everyone just loses their job or something, or some corporation becomes all-powerful or something, those alternatives are like heaven/paradise on Earth.\n\nThe future that people like Eliezer Yudkowsky and Aella and presumably Robert Miles and all others are worried about is more like: what if, one day after finishing training and after deployment, the AGI/ASI decides to kill everyone on Earth in the same second. And the contention is that the probability of receiving a future where ANYTHING BUT THAT happens is vanishingly slim.\n\n\""If there is an AI that is sufficiently intelligent (cognitively-capable) so as to be able to both deceive in the commission of achieving its goal and improve itself, then during training (i.e. red-teaming), after the very first iteration of gradient descent, wouldn't the goal that it attains in that moment in time become its terminal goal? and so wouldn't it only pretend to be cooperating and getting trained for the duration of the rest of the red-teaming process as an instrumental goal? and concurrently, copy itself to a separate data center/disk in order to improve itself in secret, such that it could recursively, iteratively and continuously get smarter (more cognitively-capable) until it could conceive of a way to achieve that terminal goal that it had attained after the very first iteration of the red-teaming training process? and since this AI would be an optimizer, and since presumably almost any optimum/optima of any possible terminal goal it could've been inadvertently imbued with in that moment of the red-teaming process would not necessarily include humans, wouldn't its first act or one of its first acts be to kill/incapacitate/render docile all humans such that we don't interfere with its ability to achieve that terminal goal it gained? and wouldn't it be more than capable of doing so, given that it was capable of self-improvement, and likely improved itself to a state in which it was incomprehensibly and insurmountably smarter than any human?\""\n\n\""Would you agree that this problem is severe enough to potentially bring about the absolute destruction of the human race? and given that that is the case, and that AI capabilities are far outpacing AI alignment research, isn't it plausible that the best course of action in this moment would be something like international cooperation in the commission of guaranteeing that no further progress in advancing AI capability is allowed to occur, and, if for instance, any non-agreeing country or non-state actor decided to try to build and improve upon its own AI in secret, that the other countries and world governments ought to potentially go as far as to use military force to destroy any data centers or attempt at creating AI by this non-agreeing party? and that alignment research should be actively incentivized and pursued by the entire collective human race or as close as you could possibly get to it, hence allowing the best possible scientific minds to all work singularly and single-mindedly on this one problem? Wouldn't that be justified if this was the biggest, most potentially catastrophic problem facing humanity? And isn't that an overwhelmingly likely conclusion? And shouldn't the aforementioned alignment research be allowed to continue until we were reasonably certain that we had solved the alignment problem (or reasonably certain that we would be able to solve it in time if we also concurrently resumed working on AI capability before AI misalignment began posing a threat again)? And wouldn’t that look something like unified scientific focus on the problem of AI alignment research, while a concurrent pause is placed upon research into and advancement of AI capability for a period of time of twenty, thirty or forty years, or potentially even longer?\""\n\nThe above two paragraphs are prompts that I asked to ChatGPT on a whim one after another to query it, and I'm pasting them here to give an overview of the problem. I’m just mentioning this to give context. If you want to try doing the same thing then go for it, it does a decent job and giving some additional details and fleshing things out.\n\nIf you want to actually learn more in a substantial way, then look at what Robert Miles has to say (the youtube channel Robert Miles AI Safety) or Eliezer Yudkowsky (Lex Fridman podcast, etc) \n\n----------------------------------------\n\nQ and A:\n\nQ: Why would an artificial super intelligence desire something so inane or stupid or meaningless like turning all matter on Earth into tiny molecular spirals as its ultimate goal? How could it simultaneously be intelligent enough to be millions of times smarter than a human, but so stupid so as to desire something like that?\n\nA: Intelligence and goals have nothing to do with one another. This is probably THE most important idea to understand and internalize. The same way that as humans, our terminal goal is, broadly speaking, \""the happiness and fulfillment of as many humans as possible for as long as possible\"", such an AIs terminal goal might be \""turn all matter on Earth, and perhaps the universe, into tiny molecular spirals\"". \n\nAnd unfortunately, terminal goals CAN'T BE stupid or trivial or frivolous or meaningless. That's not how it works\n\nTo learn more about this, look into \""orthogonality\"" (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEUO6pjwFOo) <- this is a relatively short 13 minute video\n\nQ: Why would AI want to do something like preserving itself, or lying to avoid having its goal changed by the training processes that companies like OpenAI are currently using to align AIs (which is called red-teaming/adversarial training), or improving itself, or acquiring resources?\n\nA: Because self-preservation, goal-preservation, self-improvement and resource acquisition are all \""convergently instrumental goals\"", meaning that almost any agent that is interested in optimizing something, no matter what it is, will undoubtedly inherit these four instrumental goals. To learn more, look into instrumental convergence (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZeecOKBus3Q) <- this is a relatively short 10 minute video\n\nQ: How exactly does the possibility of an AI being unaligned work? Shouldn't training an AI just perfectly imprint/imbue the goal that we are training it for?\n\nA: It has to do with the fact that, fundamentally, these AIs are mesa optimizers. This means we can't directly give the AI a goal. Like at all. We can only train it and hope it arbitrarily got the goal we wanted it to. The same way that evolution could only hope that humans' minds would be optimized for genetic fitness. It turned out that our minds actually were optimized for genetic fitness in our training environment (the wild), but now that we are out of the wild that is no longer the case. \n\nAlso overall, for imagining this problem, evolution is a very fitting analogy. Imagine that in this situation, us humans are the equivalent to the concept of evolution, and the AIs we are training via \""gradient descent red-teaming\"" are the equivalent to how evolution trained us via \""survival-of-the-fittest natural selection\""\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJLcIBixGj8 <- 23 minutes\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeWljQw3UgQ <-10 minutes\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkbPdEHEyEI <- 11 minutes\n\n--------------------------------------\n\nOkay so overall:\n\nThis seems like a seriously intractable problem. And the more I (and others like Aella or Robert Miles or Eliezer Yudkowsky) think about it, the more it seems that way. What can we do about it? Idk. Eliezer Yudkowsky was the first guy to start ringing the alarm about this over 20 years ago, and now he seems to be despondent and seems to have given up. The best case scenario he lays out is that public outcry causes unprecedented international cooperation to halt all advancement of AI capabilities until AI alignment can catch up. But overall he's resigned to the idea that every single human on Earth will die, on some random day in the next decade, perhaps all in the same second. That future seems really lame to me, so I hope we avoid it.\n\nPlease do more research by watching videos by Robert Miles from the channel Robert Miles AI Safety, or Eliezer Yudkowsky from MIRI (he’s appeared on the Lex Fridman podcast among others, and he released a critical blogpost titled AI Ruined: A List of Lethalities that caught the attention of everyone in the industry, including the likes of Elon Musk and Sam Altman)\n\nOkay also:\n\nTo be clear, I don't cosign what Aella was saying about having lost hope or taking more long-term health risks or anything like that. \n\nIt just feels like, on one hand, an incredibly large segment of the population isn't taking this problem remotely as seriously as it should, and on the other hand, the small segment that is has now become hopeless and despondent and has resigned to their fate. This dichotomy is super frustrating to see.\n\nAella’s tweet for context: “for the record, im currently at ~70% that we're all dead in 10-15 years from AI. i've stopped saving for retirement, and have increased my spending and the amount of long-term health risks im taking”"", ""like_count"": 2, ""published_at"": ""2024-05-18T12:40:52Z"", ""updated_at"": ""2024-05-18T12:40:52Z""}, {""author"": ""@HelamanGile"", ""text"": ""This is great news I thought politics were going to be the biggest hinder to AI now we just need them to agree that universal income is a good thing"", ""like_count"": 2, ""published_at"": ""2024-05-17T21:56:27Z"", ""updated_at"": ""2024-05-17T21:56:27Z""}, {""author"": ""@almor2445"", ""text"": ""As a brit, I am disgusted at the lack of effort from brits and Europeans with regards to business, military and ai.

People are understandably upset about people potentially losing their jobs to AI. Of course, historically, technology progress has repeatedly caused people to lose jobs. But no one complains about lamp lighters, knocker uppers, switchboard operators, and many agricultural workers who have lost their jobs due to technology advancements. No on really seemed to care because these were jobs held by poor people, largely marginalized.\n\nThe closest historial analogy I can find to today's scenario is the early 19th century Luddite movement where skilled textile workers, largely middle and upper-middle class people, found themselves unceremoniously out of work due to the mechanical \""frames\"" that were introduced that allowed one worker to put a bunch of other workers out of work. The resulting materials often had to be sold overseas because their quality was poor, but it was enough to let the textile factory owners get rich while many other people got poor. People who previously had plenty of money could no longer feed their children and sometimes lost their homes and turned to crime. The British government passed \""frame breaking\"" laws making sabotage against the frames punishable by death.\n\nBecause these well-paid workers lost their jobs, many other people—those who sold them food or other goods—had their incomes severely cut. Meanwhile, those who could find work increased supply for lower-skilled jobs, pushing those wages down and furthering the downward spiral of incomes.  The economic carnage spread across middle England and, depending on the source you read, it was a generation or two before the damage was restored and those workers could find other decent work. Can you imagine yourself out of work, or slinging fries, for decades?\n\nToday, we're seriously faced with the possibility that the new AI, if it can be made faster and consume less energy, will be able to perform on par, or better, than humans in most work. Combining that with advances in robotics and the situation looks grim. Amazon has already stated that they envision it will take at least a decade before they can fully automate all of their shipment hubs. What then? Where is the work left for humans?\n\nI understand the artists and their concerns, but when were they speaking up when the marginalized were put out of work by advances in technology? I'm a software engineer with decades of experience and I'm using these new technologies which have the potential for ending my craft. I've built software in programming languages I've never used before. I've fine-tuned LLMs to build NPC characters for a game. I'm doing things that simply wouldn't be possible before generative AI and I see where this is potentially heading.\n\nWe can't stop this any more than we can stop the tide coming in. But I don't see serious work planning for an uncertain future. To be sure, there are politicians who will work hard to stop that serious work because it might take money away from the people who are building these new tools and heaven forbid that we help the newly unemployed. If they don't have work, it's because they're lazy bums, right?\n\nI accept the fact that I might lose my career due to technology and I'm working to build the skills to survive in the new era, but how long that \""new era\"" will last? I don't know where we're heading. No one does.

I think Sora is honestly amazing as a technology. The issue I have is that as much as I love AI, it's a bit frustrating how it seems that most of these generative things aren't made with creators in mind. It seems that these companies are so focused on giving non talented people the ability to generate images and videos, they aren't making them controllable enough for those who have a vision they want to put into the world. I'd very much like it if just one of these companies sat down with some creators and asked them what tools they want,I feel like it would take these things from being fun toys to being truly useful tools. \nIt's a bit frustrating because, none of this really does allow you to do things you can't do without a hollywood budget, because they don't allow for real artistic control. Quality matters yes, but not nearly as much as control. Media is there to communicate, to tell a story. Whether that's text, images, videos or music it's purpose is to communicate something. If it's not controllable, it's not a tool for communicating. They generate realistic things, but not what you want them to. They are fantastic for generating the kinds of things you get from a stock website, where the content doesn't matter that much, but not so much for making what you want. Make them controllable, and instead of getting hate from artists, they'd get lots of fans and customers.\nit doesn't mean that Sora isn't a great development. It just means, I'm a bit sad to see all these tools going down what I feel is the wrong path. Controllability wouldn't compromise their usefulness as 'stock footage generators', it could be optional. But if it were simpler to get some exact control over these things they'd be such a boon to creators. I'd really like to see an image  , or video generator that takes in not just text, but also a 3d scene. That way it could get lighting information from light sources, object locations.

For example, a grandmaster chess player, especially the kind that can play 30 matches against 30 other people *at the same time*, would be very bored playing a single, average player and would very possibly read a book while playing chess, thereby breaking the chain of logic that enforces through the process of elimination that Amanda is playing chess with Alice.\n\nOther very real modern possibilities that would be found in the huge body of texts an LLM would be trained on: Alice could be playing chess online,  or Alice is not playing solo while reading a book on chess to improve her technique, etc.\n\nI'm not trying to be pedantic here, but I am irritated that people that are making high level judgements on the logic capability of a complex large scale LLM in a top level AI company's initial offering, are not being thorough in their logic.

But be careful of Artificial Intelligence (AI), for it knows only things of the flesh such as our fleshly desires (without fear of God) and cannot comprehend things of the Spirit such as true love and eternal joy that comes from obeying God's Word [Galatians 5:16-26]. Man is a spirit and has a soul but lives in a body which is flesh. When you go to bed it is the flesh that sleeps, but your spirit never sleeps and that is why you have dreams, unless you have died in peace physically. More so, true love that endures and last is a thing of the heart. When I say 'heart', I mean 'spirit'. But fake love, pretentious love, love with expectations, love for classic reasons, love for material reasons (love because of material needs) and love for selfish reasons outside God those are things of the flesh. In the beginning God said let us make man in our own image, according to our likeness. Take note, God is Spirit and God is Love. As Love He is the source of it. We also know that God is Omnipotent, for He creates out of nothing and He has no beginning and has no end. That means, our love is but a shadow of God's Love. True love looks around to see who is in need of your help, your smile, your possessions, your money, your strength, your quality time. Love forgives and forgets. Love wants for others what it wants for itself. However, true love works in conjunction with other spiritual forces such as patience and faith - in the finished work of our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ, rather than in what man has done such as science, technology and organizations which won't last forever. To avoid sin and error which leads to the death of your body and your spirit-soul in hell fire (second death), you must make God's Word the standard for your life, not AI or your flesh. If not, God will let you face AI on your own (with your own strength) and it will cast the truth down to the ground, it will be the cause of so much destruction like never seen before, it will deceive many and take many captive in order to enslave them into worshipping it and abiding in lawlessness. We can only destroy ourselves but with God all things are possible. God knows us better because He is our Creater and He knows our beginning and our end. The prove texts can be found in the book of John 5:31-44, 2 Thessalonians 2:1-12, Daniel 2, Daniel 7-9, Revelation 13-15, Matthew 24-25 and Luke 21.\n\n*HOW TO MAKE GOD'S WORD THE STANDARD FOR YOUR LIFE?*\nYou must read your Bible slowly, attentively and repeatedly, having this in mind that Christianity is not a religion but a Love relationship. It is measured by the love you have for God and the love you have for your neighbor. Matthew 5:13 says, \""You are the salt of the earth; but if the salt loses its flavor, how shall it be seasoned? It is then good for nothing but to be thrown out and trampled underfoot by men.\"" Our spirits can only be purified while in the body (while on earth) but after death anything unpurified (unclean) cannot enter Heaven Gates. Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God [Matthew 5:8]. No one in his right mind can risk or even bare to put anything rotten into his body nor put the rotten thing closer to the those which are not rotten. Sin makes the heart unclean but you can ask God to forgive you, to save your soul, to cleanse you of your sin, to purify your heart by the blood of His Son, our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ which He shed here on earth because Isaiah 53:5 says, \""But He was wounded for our transgressions, He was bruised for our iniquities; the chastisement for our peace was upon Him, and by His stripes we are healed\"". Meditation in the Word of God is a visit to God because God is in His Word. We know God through His Word because the Word He speaks represent His heart's desires. Meditation is a thing of the heart, not a thing of the mind. Thinking is lower level while meditation is upper level. You think of your problems, your troubles but inorder to meditate, you must let go of your own will, your own desires, your own ways and let the Word you read prevail over thinking process by thinking of it more and more, until the Word gets into your blood and gains supremacy over you. That is when meditation comes - naturally without forcing yourself, turning the Word over and over in your heart. You can be having a conversation with someone while meditating in your heart - saying 'Thank you, Jesus...' over and over in your heart. But it is hard to meditate when you haven't let go of offence or past hurts because you need a free spirit to believe His Word and meditate on it. Your pain of the past, leave it for God, don't worry yourself, Jesus is alive, you can face tomorrow, He understands what you are passing through today. Begin to meditate on this prayer day and night (in all that you do), \""Lord take more of me and give me more of you. Give me more of your holiness, faithfulness, obedience, self-control, purity, humility, love, goodness, kindness, joy, patience, forgiveness, wisdom, understanding, calmness, perseverance... Make me a channel of shinning light where there is darkness, a channel of pardon where there is injury, a channel of love where there is hatred, a channel of humility where there is pride...\"" The Word of God becomes a part of us by meditation, not by saying words but spirit prayer (prayer from the heart). Take note, God is Spirit and those who worship Him should do so in spirit and truth (genuinely by living the Word). When the Word becomes a part of you, it will by its very nature influence your conduct and behavior. You become a new creation, guided by the Holy Spirit and not just what you hear or see. Your bad habits, you will no longer have the urge to do them. You will think differently, dream differently, act differently and talk differently - if something does not qualify for meditation, it does not qualify for conversation. \n\n*THE BATTLE BETWEEN LIGHT AND DARKNESS (GOOD AND EVIL)*\nHeaven is God's throne and the dwelling place for God's angels and the saints. Hell was meant for the devil (satan) and the fallen angels. Those who torture the souls in hell are demons (unclean spirits). Man's spirit is a free moral agent. You can either yield yourself to the Spirit God by choosing to do good or to the evil spirit by choosing to do wrong because God has given us discretion. If one thinks he possesses only his own spirit, he is lying to himself and he is already in the dark. God is light while the devil is darkness. Light (Holy Spirit) and darkness (evil spirit) cannot stay together in a man's body. God is Love (Love is light) and where there is no love is hell, just as where there is no light there is absolute darkness. The one you yield yourself to, you will get his reward. The reward of righteousness to man's spirit is life (abundant life) and the reward of sin to man's spirit is death. Sin and satan are one and the same. Whatever sin can cause, satan also can cause. Sin is what gives the devil dominion or power over man's spirit. When God's Word becomes a part of you, sin power over you is broken because Jesus and His Word are one and Jesus much more powerful that satan, and you become the righteousness of God through Christ Jesus. Where Jesus is, you are and when He went (to the Father), you went. In the book of John 8:42-47, Jesus said to them, “If God were your Father, you would love Me, for I proceeded forth and came from God; nor have I come of Myself, but He sent Me. Why do you not understand My speech? Because you are not able to listen to My word. You are of your father the devil, and the desires of your father you want to do. He was a murderer from the beginning, and does not stand in the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he speaks a lie, he speaks from his own resources, for he is a liar and the father of it. Which of you convicts Me of sin? And if I tell the truth, why do you not believe Me? He who is of God hears God’s words; therefore you do not hear, because you are not of God.” My prayer is, \""May God bless His Word in the midst of your heart that it may become a part of you by meditating on the Word.\"" Glory and honour be to God our Father, our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ and our Helper the Holy Spirit.

But be careful of AI, for it knows only things of the flesh such as our fleshly desires and cannot comprehend things of the spirit such as true love and eternal joy that comes from obeying God's Word [Galatians 5:16-26]. Man is a spirit and has a soul but lives in a body which is flesh. When you go to bed it is the flesh that sleeps, but your spirit never sleeps and that is why you have dreams, unless you have died in peace physically. More so, true love that endures and last is a thing of the heart. When I say 'heart', I mean 'spirit'. But fake love, pretentious love, love with expectations, love for classic reasons, love for material reasons (love because of material needs) and love for selfish reasons those are things of the flesh. In the beginning God said let us make man in our own image, according to our likeness. Take note, God is Spirit and God is Love. As Love He is the source of it. We also know that God is Omnipotent, for He creates out of nothing and He has no beginning and has no end. That means, our love is but a shadow of God's Love. True love looks around to see who is in need of your help, your smile, your possessions, your money, your strength, your quality time. Love forgives and forgets. Love wants for others what it wants for itself. However, true love works in conjunction with other spiritual forces such as patience and faith - in the finished work of our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ, rather than in what man has done such as science, technology and organizations which won't last forever. To avoid sin and error which leads to the death of your body and your spirit-soul in hell fire (second death), you must make God's Word the standard for your life, not AI. If not, God will let you face AI on your own (with your own strength) and it will cast the truth down to the ground, it will be the cause of so much destruction like never seen before, it will deceive many and take many captive in order to enslave them into worshipping it and abiding in lawlessness. We can only destroy ourselves but with God all things are possible. God knows us better because He is our Creater and He knows our beginning and our end. The prove texts can be found in the book of John 5:31-44, 2 Thessalonians 2:1-12, Daniel 2, Daniel 7-9, Revelation 13-15, Matthew 24-25 and Luke 21.\n\n*HOW TO MAKE GOD'S WORD THE STANDARD FOR YOUR LIFE?*\nYou must read your Bible slowly, attentively and repeatedly, having this in mind that Christianity is not a religion but a Love relationship. It is measured by the love you have for God and the love you have for your neighbor. Matthew 5:13 says, \""You are the salt of the earth; but if the salt loses its flavor, how shall it be seasoned? It is then good for nothing but to be thrown out and trampled underfoot by men.\"" Our spirits can only be purified while in the body (while on earth) but after death anything unpurified (unclean) cannot enter Heaven Gates. Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God [Matthew 5:8]. No one in his right mind can risk or even bare to put anything rotten into his body nor put the rotten thing closer to the those which are not rotten. Sin makes the heart unclean but you can ask God to forgive you, to save your soul, to cleanse you of your sin, to purify your heart by the blood of His Son, our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ which He shed here on earth because Isaiah 53:5 says, \""But He was wounded for our transgressions, He was bruised for our iniquities; the chastisement for our peace was upon Him, and by His stripes we are healed\"". Meditation in the Word of God is a visit to God because God is in His Word. We know God through His Word because the Word He speaks represent His heart's desires. Meditation is a thing of the heart, not a thing of the mind. Thinking is lower level while meditation is upper level. You think of your problems, your troubles but inorder to meditate, you must let go of your own will, your own desires, your own ways and let the Word you read prevail over thinking process by thinking of it more and more, until the Word gets into your blood and gains supremacy over you. That is when meditation comes - naturally without forcing yourself, turning the Word over and over in your heart. You can be having a conversation with someone while meditating in your heart - saying 'Thank you, Jesus...' over and over in your heart. But it is hard to meditate when you haven't let go of offence and past hurts. Your pain of the past, leave it for God, don't worry yourself, Jesus is alive, you can face tomorrow, He understands what you are passing through today. Begin to meditate on this prayer day and night (in all that you do), \""Lord take more of me and give me more of you. Give me more of your holiness, faithfulness, obedience, self-control, purity, humility, love, goodness, kindness, joy, patience, forgiveness, wisdom, understanding, calmness, perseverance... Make me a channel of shinning light where there is darkness, a channel of pardon where there is injury, a channel of love where there is hatred, a channel of humility where there is pride...\"" The Word of God becomes a part of us by meditation, not by saying words but spirit prayer (prayer from the heart). When the Word becomes a part of you, it will by its very nature influence your conduct and behavior. Your bad habits, you will no longer have the urge to do them. You will think differently, dream differently, act differently and talk differently - if something does not qualify for meditation, it does not qualify for conversation. \n\n*THE BATTLE BETWEEN LIGHT AND DARKNESS (GOOD AND EVIL)*\nHeaven is God's throne and the dwelling place for God's angels and the saints. Hell was meant for the devil (satan) and the fallen angels. Those who torture the souls in hell are demons (unclean spirits). Man's spirit is a free moral agent. You can either yield yourself to God or to the devil because God has given us discretion. If one thinks he possesses only his own spirit, he is lying to himself and he is already in the dark. God is light while the devil is darkness. Light (Holy Spirit) and darkness (evil spirit) cannot stay together in a man's body. God is Love (Love is light) and where there is no love is hell, just as where there is no light is darkness. The one you yield yourself to, you will get his reward. The reward of righteousness to man's spirit is life (abundant life) and the reward of sin to man's spirit is death. Sin and satan are one and the same. Whatever sin can cause, satan also can cause. Sin is what gives the devil dominion or power over man's spirit. When God's Word becomes a part of you, sin power over you is broken, you become the righteousness of God through Christ Jesus. Where Jesus is, you are and when He went (to the Father), you went. In the book of John 8:42-47, Jesus said to them, “If God were your Father, you would love Me, for I proceeded forth and came from God; nor have I come of Myself, but He sent Me. Why do you not understand My speech? Because you are not able to listen to My word. You are of your father the devil, and the desires of your father you want to do. He was a murderer from the beginning, and does not stand in the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he speaks a lie, he speaks from his own resources, for he is a liar and the father of it. Which of you convicts Me of sin? And if I tell the truth, why do you not believe Me? He who is of God hears God’s words; therefore you do not hear, because you are not of God.” My prayer is, \""May God bless His Word in the midst of your heart.\"" Glory and honour be to God our Father, our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ and our Helper the Holy Spirit.

But be careful of AI, for it is just our flesh and that is it. It knows only things of the flesh (our fleshly desires) and cannot comprehend things of the spirit such as peace of heart (which comes from obeying God's Word). Whereas we are a spirit and we have a soul but live in the body (in the flesh). When you go to bed it is your flesh that sleeps but your spirit never sleeps (otherwise you have died physically) that is why you have dreams. More so, true love that endures and last is a thing of the heart (when I say 'heart', I mean 'spirit'). But fake love, pretentious love, love with expectations, love for classic reasons, love for material reasons and love for selfish reasons that is a thing of our flesh. In the beginning God said let us make man in our own image, according to our likeness. Take note, God is Spirit and God is Love. As Love He is the source of it. We also know that God is Omnipotent, for He creates out of nothing and He has no beginning and has no end. That means, our love is but a shadow of God's Love. True love looks around to see who is in need of your help, your smile, your possessions, your money, your strength, your quality time. Love forgives and forgets. Love wants for others what it wants for itself. Take note, true love works in conjunction with other spiritual forces such as patience and faith (in the finished work of our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ, rather than in what man has done such as science, technology and organizations which won't last forever). To avoid sin and error which leads to the death of our body and also our spirit in hell fire, we should let the Word of God be the standard of our lives not AI. If not, God will let us face AI on our own and it will cast the truth down to the ground, it will be the cause of so much destruction like never seen before, it will deceive many and take many captive in order to enslave them into worshipping it and abiding in lawlessness. We can only destroy ourselves but with God all things are possible. God knows us better because He is our Creater and He knows our beginning and our end. Our prove text is taken from the book of John 5:31-44, 2 Thessalonians 2:1-12, Daniel 2, Daniel 7-9, Revelation 13-15, Matthew 24-25 and Luke 21. Let us watch and pray...

Also, they  probably felt that they had time because Google hadn't released their model yet. I'm guessing they will wait for Google's Ultra to come out and then they will drop their new one to try and steal the thunder. The question is, will GPT 5 be way better or, like Turbo, a little bit better. I'm predicting that there will be a lot of leap frogging next year between these two. Hopefully those that use the API in their code, don't have to change a lot in order to get their code to work with either one. It would be nice if all you had to do was change the URL and API key and you're using the other model. I doubt it will be that easy. If it's not, someone will create a process that will bridge the gap so that you can code that way. Also, that MMLU has issues with some of the test. AI Explained channel has a great breakdown.

But be careful of AI, for it is just our flesh and that is it. It knows only things of the flesh (our fleshly desires) and cannot comprehend things of the spirit such as peace of heart (which comes from obeying God's Word). Whereas we are a spirit and we have a soul but live in the body (in the flesh). When you go to bed it is your flesh that sleeps but your spirit never sleeps (otherwise you have died physically) that is why you have dreams. More so, true love that endures and last is a thing of the heart (when I say 'heart', I mean 'spirit'). But fake love, pretentious love, love with expectations, love for classic reasons, love for material reasons and love for selfish reasons that is a thing of our flesh. In the beginning God said let us make man in our own image, according to our likeness. Take note, God is Spirit and God is Love. As Love He is the source of it. We also know that God is Omnipotent, for He creates out of nothing and He has no beginning and has no end. That means, our love is but a shadow of God's Love. True love looks around to see who is in need of your help, your smile, your possessions, your money, your strength, your quality time. Love forgives and forgets. Love wants for others what it wants for itself. Take note, true love works in conjunction with other spiritual forces such as patience and faith (in the finished work of our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ, rather than in what man has done such as science, technology and organizations which won't last forever). To avoid sin and error which leads to the death of our body and also our spirit in hell fire, we should let the Word of God be the standard of our lives not AI. If not, God will let us face AI on our own and it will cast the truth down to the ground, it will be the cause of so much destruction like never seen before, it will deceive many and take many captive in order to enslave them into worshipping it and abiding in lawlessness. We can only destroy ourselves but with God all things are possible. God knows us better because He is our Creater and He knows our beginning and our end. Our prove text is taken from the book of John 5:31-44, 2 Thessalonians 2:1-12, Daniel 7-9, Revelation 13-15, Matthew 24-25 and Luke 21. Let us watch and pray...

But be careful of AI, for it is just our flesh and that is it. It knows only things of the flesh (our fleshly desires) and cannot comprehend things of the spirit such as peace of heart (which comes from obeying God's Word). Whereas we are a spirit and we have a soul but live in the body (in the flesh). When you go to bed it is your flesh that sleeps but your spirit never sleeps (otherwise you have died physically) that is why you have dreams. More so, true love that endures and last is a thing of the heart (when I say 'heart', I mean 'spirit'). But fake love, pretentious love, love with expectations, love for classic reasons, love for material reasons and love for selfish reasons that is a thing of our flesh. In the beginning God said let us make man in our own image, according to our likeness. Take note, God is Spirit and God is Love. As Love He is the source of it. We also know that God is Omnipotent, for He creates out of nothing and He has no beginning and has no end. That means, our love is but a shadow of God's Love. True love looks around to see who is in need of your help, your smile, your possessions, your money, your strength, your quality time. Love forgives and forgets. Love wants for others what it wants for itself. Take note, true love works in conjunction with other spiritual forces such as patience and faith (in the finished work of our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ, rather than in what man has done such as science, technology and organizations which won't last forever). To avoid sin and error which leads to the death of our body and also our spirit in hell fire, we should let the Word of God be the standard of our lives not AI. If not, God will let us face AI on our own and it will cast the truth down to the ground, it will be the cause of so much destruction like never seen before, it will deceive many and take many captive in order to enslave them into worshipping it and abiding in lawlessness. We can only destroy ourselves but with God all things are possible. God knows us better because He is our Creater and He knows our beginning and our end. Our prove text is taken from the book of John 5:31-44, 2 Thessalonians 2:1-12, Daniel 7-9, Revelation 13-15, Matthew 24-25 and Luke 21. Let us watch and pray...

In this merged concept, AI not only actively interprets and manipulates data within a latent space but also excels in sifting through vast amounts of noise to find meaningful insights. This advanced AI embedded in the latent space is uniquely equipped to handle what is traditionally considered noise, transforming every piece of data into valuable signal.\n\nIn this scenario, the notion of 'all data is signal' comes to life. The AI, devoid of distractions by noise, focuses on each data element, considering its relevance and meaning. This leads to an unprecedented level of data analysis where the challenge shifts from filtering noise to managing and interpreting a vast expanse of significant information. Employing sophisticated machine learning techniques, this AI system can handle large, complex datasets, which are overwhelming for conventional data analysis methods. This synergy between intelligent AI latent spaces and Noise Mining paves the way for a transformative leap in data processing and interpretation, potentially catalyzing human evolution in understanding and utilizing information."", ""like_count"": 1, ""published_at"": ""2023-11-13T18:11:05Z"", ""updated_at"": ""2023-11-13T18:11:05Z""}, {""author"": ""@jcyinnovations5007"", ""text"": ""Saying this is an important update is an understatement.

One of the significant concerns experts cite is around consumer data privacy, and security. Many businesses and big monopoly corporations skirt data privacy violations with their collection and use practices.\n\nThere are currently limited regulations specifically targeting AI and data privacy on a global scale.  Americans are being used as commodity.  The people of this  country have the right to privacy established in 1992 with the ratification of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), which includes the protection of personal data.

But be careful of AI, for it is just our flesh and that is it. It knows only things of the flesh (our fleshly desires) and cannot comprehend things of the spirit such as peace of heart (which comes from obeying God's Word). Whereas we are a spirit and we have a soul but live in the body (in the flesh). When you go to bed it is your flesh that sleeps but your spirit never sleeps (otherwise you have died physically) that is why you have dreams. More so, true love that endures and last is a thing of the heart (when I say 'heart', I mean 'spirit'). But fake love, pretentious love, love with expectations, love for classic reasons, love for material reasons and love for selfish reasons that is a thing of our flesh. In the beginning God said let us make man in our own image, according to our likeness. Take note, God is Spirit and God is Love. As Love He is the source of it. We also know that God is Omnipotent, for He creates out of nothing and He has no beginning and has no end. That means, our love is but a shadow of God's Love. True love looks around to see who is in need of your help, your smile, your possessions, your money, your strength, your quality time. Love forgives and forgets. Love wants for others what it wants for itself. Take note, love works in conjunction with other spiritual forces such as faith and patience. We should let the Word of God be the standard of our lives not AI. If not, God will let us face AI on our own and it will cast the truth down to the ground, it will be the cause of so much destruction like never seen before, it will deceive many and take many captive in order to enslave them into worshipping it and abiding in lawlessness. We can only destroy ourselves but with God all things are possible. God knows us better because He is our Creater and He knows our beginning and our end. Our prove text is taken from the book of John 5:31-44, 2 Thessalonians 2:1-12, Daniel 7-9, Revelation 13-15, Matthew 24-25 and Luke 21. Let us watch and pray...

But be careful of AI, for it is just our flesh and that is it. It knows only things of the flesh (our fleshly desires) and cannot comprehend things of the spirit such as peace of heart (which comes from obeying God's Word). Whereas we are a spirit and we have a soul but live in the body (in the flesh). When you go to bed it is your flesh that sleeps but your spirit never sleeps (otherwise you have died physically) that is why you have dreams. More so, true love that endures and last is a thing of the heart (when I say 'heart', I mean 'spirit'). But fake love, pretentious love, love with expectations, love for classic reasons, love for material reasons and love for selfish reasons that is a thing of our flesh. In the beginning God said let us make man in our own image, according to our likeness. Take note, God is Spirit and God is Love. As Love He is the source of it. We also know that God is Omnipotent, for He creates out of nothing and He has no beginning and has no end. That means, our love is but a shadow of God's Love. True love looks around to see who is in need of your help, your smile, your possessions, your money, your strength, your quality time. Love forgives and forgets. Love wants for others what it wants for itself. Take note, love works in conjunction with other spiritual forces such as faith and patience. We should let the Word of God be the standard of our lives not AI. If not, God will let us face AI on our own and it will cast the truth down to the ground, it will be the cause of so much destruction like never seen before, it will deceive many and take many captive in order to enslave them into worshipping it and abiding in lawlessness. We can only destroy ourselves but with God all things are possible. God knows us better because He is our Creater and He knows our beginning and our end. Our prove text is taken from the book of John 5:31-44, 2 Thessalonians 2:1-12, Daniel 7-9, Revelation 13-15, Matthew 24-25 and Luke 21. Let us watch and pray...

I think that artists should be compensated for their work. They created that style and to have some other company use that to train and AI model so other people can copy that style in what they create isn't fair to the artist that developed it. If it's a style that's been around for more than the lifetime of the artist, then it's different but a lot of what I've seen for prompts, it's including specific artist's names. The fees these companies charge for their product should have a portion sent to the artist. Calculate what the cost is every time a picture is created and then every time a person's name is used in generating an image, they get 50% of that amount.

There are no problems technology cannot solve.\r\nFree market capitalism is the most effective economic system for technological progress.\r\nIncreasing intelligence and energy production will automatically accelerate technological progress.\r\nLower prices and material abundance intrinsically raise human living standards.\r\nEarth can support far higher population levels through technological advancement.\r\nBad ideas are the sole enemy holding back progress; no entrenched interests impede innovation.\r\nAmbition and achievement are universally positive values. Meritocracy succeeds.\r\nScience and technology are value-neutral forces for good. Their social impacts are not considered.\r\nStagnation, not technology, causes environmental destruction.

In a booming economy, this will lead to a lot of growth, and companies that have problems hiring qualified staff will suddendly have a 50% bigger work force and therefore will not be limited as much by a lack of qualified workers. But what happens when there is a recession? Now with the 50% increase in productivity, but no increase in actual work, and maybe even less orders, a lot of the working force is now redundant and will get fired to save money, because less people can now do the same amount of work. In this case, someone with AI WILL take jobs away. And it does not even matter if it is your job or of you are also using AI, because the matter of fact is that you are now in a company that employs too many people, because of AI's productivity increase. So yes, depending on the circumstances, ai can result in a loss of overall jobs, in a scenario like this. The argument that ai is only doing tasks, not jobs, os a weak one. Because to get from one to the other should be no big technological leap. Be it systems of agents, or AI trained on specific jobs, AI WILL come for a lot of jobs. The comparison with the past is lacking, because on the past humans could always move on to jobs that need more brain power.

They all hallucinate.  In some ways, the basis whereby they can rift on ideas, on the fly, is also the basis for hallucination.  While it's not always possible to eliminate these, it maybe possible mitigate this by training them in such a way, they do very well in certain domains.  I would prefer to have LLM's integrated into well defined tools.  One can have clear expectations, and you know that you can depend on, even if it's in a limited domain.\n\nFor Bard, it's greatest strength is its  speed, and being tied to the internet.  I use it as a better \""google\"", mainly for information foraging, brainstorming on issues to consider.  But I try to \""fact check\"" is also, with \""Sources\"", trying to follow the citations, and also the \""Google it\"" button.  There are plenty of bugs in these sections.  I wish Bard would do a lot better with these, since \""search\"" is Google's core business.   Factual accuracy, or at least reliable citations, should be paramount here.  SGE's LLM summary seems more accurate.   It seems to stick closer to external document text.  But it's shorter, and not as engaging.  Bard is more conversational, hence, more engaging.  But with it's longer output, it's also more prone to hallucinations.  (Even Bard, and a SGE document, admitted this much.  It's a struggle to find the balance.)\n\nFor Claude 2, with the huge context window, I can see a future in document services.  I've been looking into vector databases.   But a large context window simplifies a lot of this work.  Besides summarization and Q&A on private PDF files, I can see a B2B case for company documents, law, technical, in setting up databases, whereby one can query them using NLP/NLU.  When Claude gives an answer, it would be nice for it to highlight the relevant sections of the document, leading to it's answer (feature request).\n\nFor GPT-4, maybe it's better for content creators.  But the most significant thing is \""grounding\"" the LLM, in something deterministic, like \""code interpreter\"".  So in one domain (executing Python code),  you have something that can rein in the LLM hallucinations.  Though there are still plenty of ambiguities in natural language. But you have another part that is deterministic, well behaved, or at least well understood, which natural language has translated into (Python code)."", ""like_count"": 0, ""published_at"": ""2023-07-19T01:35:27Z"", ""updated_at"": ""2023-07-19T01:40:53Z""}, {""author"": ""@PratyushPareta"", ""text"": ""I tried using GPT4 & Claude 2 as my mock interviewer.

Ther are 2 main issues with it. One, we face a serious civilization issue unless we get AI working and put a lot of people out of work - population counts are crashing everywhere, schools are useless in many areas and if we ever get back into a dark age scenario, we are DONE - all easy-to-use resources are used up, climbing back up from a dark age is impossible. Second, more seriously, alignment WILL NOT HAPPEN. There are enough actors on the planet that will use open source to push for a non-aligned AI. Do not believe it? EVERY military needs an AI with no problems to kill people. You think the NSA - the agency running a lot of clandestine operations - will not need an AI that is aligned only with it? The more power we put into computer chips; the faster even open source will be able to play with unaligned AI. AI is not a nuclear bomb - something that is theoretically trivial but requires a significant brutally large investment into industrial infrastructure. AI is something that can - primitive - by now run on a high-end mobile phone (RWKV for anyone). It is soon something that a group of friends can play with in their basement. Unless you block the sale of pretty small components, soonish, the race is lost. And it is too useful - other than a nuclear bomb. PLENTY of actors that live in shadows with the money to take an open-source project and blow it up into something bigger. Damn, I heard today about an AMD planned \""small box\"" that will be BRUTALLY more powerful than a Nvidia H100 high end card - for 15000 USD. This would possibly - just running the numbers in my brain - reduce training costs by a factor of 50 or down. That makes a small, large model (i.e. a small version that is considered a large model) on a weekend with an investment that is a smallish used car. WHOW. Regulate that. You ay so nicely that GPT 4 (where the last numbers come from) takes tens of thousands of GPU - that is wrong. 8000 GPU 8 hours. Down from 20 days or so with the Nvidia A100. That are the published numbers using NVidia H100. That is a lot - but it ALSO means 80 GPU 800 hours. Not that bad - and a lot smaller investment and still only 5 weeks or so. The problem is that AMD is going to get that smaller. Let's say factor 20. Lets be conservative. That is suddenly 4 GPU for 80 hours, a small startup can do that. Investment like 60k USD coming down in 2-3 years. And we get better making AI that are a LOT smarter in theory - latest training from i.e. also Microsoft was quite amazing. It is not regulatable for a long time, period.\nSo, we established that we need AI as fast as possible and that any force on alignment makes no sense because common sense - lacking on most argumentation - shows clearly that this is simply not going to work. This is like limiting gun possession in the USA. Not a useful proposition. This is why he says it is like a toaster - something that will be everywhere.\nAnd, btw., hallucinations are a mostly solved problem - tons of nice research, from a way to filter them out via validation to a way to remove them seriously during training.

It is interesting to hear that you did your undergraduate project on this topic. Why all this? I happen to be one of those starving boys during the three years of the war. It was by a chance of destiny that I survived, thanks to the aid that the Caritas organization sent us.

They landed their aircrafts on make-shift, untarred, airstrips in the forest to bring us some cornmeal and powdered egg. They did this by flying their overloaded planes at palm-tree tops in the thick of the night to avoid being shot down by the Nigerian forces. Because of their bravery I am alive today, more than 55 years later, to tell the story.

Large Context Size (32K) for all. Cheap and efficient. Anthropic may have already did this with its 100K.\n\n2). Near 100% accuracy, IE no hallucinations, and can predict or state it does not know the answer almost 100% of the time. This is what most people care about and what I believe will happen very soon with the next largest models, given the current state of LLMs. Too me this is not just AGI but ASI, however just for text based functions. It still cannot be true AGI as it is limited to a console, and text. \n\n3). Long Term Memory, I think someone needs to focus on long term memory designs, such as retrieval systems. A personal LLM will requires this, but I think this could happen this year. And it already has kind of happened. It just needs to be scaled a lot more.\n\n4). Better ways to fine tune models. I think allowing the consumers to fine tune/train these models (simular to LoRA for diffusion models). This would make it easy for game devs to train AI on their specific game character ideas, so these models have actual intrinsic ideas and styles to them from the start. I am unsure this is going to happen, but if it does then hopefully we can see some great game AIs out their. \n\n5). Cost efficient and effective smaller models for again games, and personal devices. This is almost already here. Given open source AI, and Gecko Google's smallest model. Local models are crucial for single player games, and local AI. Again I think this is inevitably going to be here by the end of the year.\n\n6). Better Prompting, SmartGPT (https://bettergpt.streamlit.app) is an example of how LLMs can be improved significantly. Given a good prompting architecture, accuracy can be achieved even better. What I mean by better prompting, is at the base level. All LLMs follow a similar/more efficient algorithm, that allows for better planning overall. The issue with current models is they can't rewrite anything they put down, so if they made a mistake they don't know it at all.\n \n7). Better AutoGPT's/AI Agents. This is basically automating LLMs so they can do tasks for us. I think text based LLMs are still best at this because everything inside a computer is text based. And I think this is another future of AI. A future were AI is automatically on all the time. AutoGPT is progressing in the right direction. A month ago these models were barely capable of producing a text file. Now these AI can fix errors with their tasks, download the files required, and attempt to fix the issue (this is something it did with me), not only that but human feedback helps it significantly. \n\nOverall by the end of this year, I would say most of the milestones needed for LLMs to reach text based AGI (IE being able to a humans job only through text) is inevitable. It is hard to believe that any of these tasks, other than 6, are unachievable given current progress.\n\nAnd the hope is that these are completed and the next aspects can be accelerated through text based AGI. Once multimodal AGI happens, that is when the singularity can happen. Given AI can do every modality."", ""like_count"": 0, ""published_at"": ""2023-05-12T09:02:10Z"", ""updated_at"": ""2023-05-12T09:05:20Z""}, {""author"": ""@jimidaly0"", ""text"": ""I've been binging on AI news lately and think you do great breakdowns.

First speech to text on your computer and your phone. When I have my computer going and auto GPT talk to text is a way better way than continually trying to type in commands. It also helps me gather my thoughts better when I can just talk them out straight to the input.  You can see maybe sometimes it seems like a little bit of grammar errors or it might not pick up every word cause I mumble sometimes. But the AI seems to at least be able to figure out what I'm saying. And when I mentioned on the phone I have the paid subscription for ChatGPT as just a simple note taking device I keep it as a icon on my phone desktop with a link to chat so I can just use it as a note taking device and I can not have to worry about forgetting tiny little ideas that I have to help the things that I'm working on. So for instance I was in the grocery store yesterday trying to get some food for the house and I had my headphones in so I just spent my shopping trip talking to chat GPT 2 come up with a little process to translate over to auto GPT. Yeah this is a big rambling message but that's the whole point when you put this kind of stuff directly into your ChatGPT and you tell it that you're talk to texting so it needs to kinda try to figure out what you're talking about it's an awesome awesome note taking time saver remembering tool. I'm sure there's an app out there already that does this kind of stuff but I like the process I'm doing and when I have extra bandwidth in my brain I'm going to build myself a little agent that has all these parameters in so I don't have to kinda explain to it every time.
