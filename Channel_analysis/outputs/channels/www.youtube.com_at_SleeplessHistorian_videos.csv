Milk and buttermilk were staples, providing that creamy comfort. Meat? That was a luxury, saved for special occasions‚Äîlike a surprise visit from a long-lost cousin! Fish and wild greens popped up too, adding a splash of variety to their everyday fare. Now, picture the scene at a king‚Äôs banquet! The aroma is entirely different‚Äîthere‚Äôs roasted venison, boar sizzling over the fire, and platters piled high with fresh fish. Sweet pastries that would make your mouth water and exotic spices that tickle your nose add flair to these feasts. It‚Äôs not just food; it‚Äôs a celebration! Music fills the hall, poets entertain, and every dish is served in stunning containers fit for royalty. Talk about a feast for the senses! But whether you‚Äôre dining as a peasant or a king, the folks in medieval Ireland knew how to embrace the seasons! They used clever preservation techniques to make sure they had enough grub through the long winters. And let‚Äôs not overlook the bonding experiences‚Äîfasting and feasting together nurtured strong community ties, making mealtimes ripe for storytelling and laughter. Irish cuisine was more than just sustenance; it was a connecting thread woven into the very fabric of their cultural identity.

My mama is sure one day someone will choose me, as I am and not for what they can maybe gain from me. That someone won't care that I cannot make money and that I struggle a lot to understand this world,let alone myself, that someone will love me as I am. Without conditional love or judgment. I tell her I wish that were true. I know in my heart that my love is and can be enough. I give all of me when I love. My heart knows no limit, when I care if they want me in their life forever then they shall get to keep me. Though I do not chase. Trying to chase just hurts more. \nYou cannot force friendship nor love. I wouldn't want fake people whose lips lie and tell of a rose gold life anyway, I would rather suffer life alone forever than that. Realness is More important.\n\nIt makes me happy and proud to hear of people with disabilities living their best life,even if I never have that. \nThere is a small hope about that.\nI am so glad I clicked this video and thank you, also for the second story being about something so fascinating that I stopped crying.
